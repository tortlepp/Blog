I got this indeed useful exception while I was working with Apache POI:

[![Rule M2.4 exception: this error should NEVER happen](2016/this_error_should_never_happen.png)](2016/this_error_should_never_happen.png)

Ah, now I know what went wrong! Isn't it obvious? &mdash; And although this error should never happen I am [not the first one](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53613) who met it while working with Apache POI.
