Almost a year ago I started a project called [SimpleTaskList](https://github.com/tortlepp/SimpleTaskList) with the intention to create an easy to use editor for todo.txt files. And because the file format is fairly easy and well documented my development progress was fast. Within some weeks I implemented all necessary features and around five months ago the project was almost ready to release version 1.0, the first official and stable version.

Unfortunately, there were many other things to do as well, so I did not have enough time for some last tests and the final release. But finally, during the last week, I took the time. I added some small improvements that were still missing and then did the final tests. Because I did not find any remaining bugs or inconveniences, yesterday evening I was ready to release version 1.0 of SimpleTaskList.

At the moment I am considering SimpleTaskList as *feature complete*. That means I implemented all necessary and useful features and there are no known bugs in the software. In my opinion, it does not make sense to continue development and implement features that are not needed by anybody. So I will stop active development right here. Of course, if somebody finds a bug and reports it, I will fix it and release a fixed version of SimpleTaskList.

Some people may say that a software project / product is never finished. But actually I think it can. Remember, Mozilla made a similar [remark on Thunderbird](https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/06/thunderbird-stability-and-community-innovation/) some time ago. And putting SimpleTaskList out of my focus gives me the possibility to continue with some other projects, for example [BlogBuilder](2016/a_new_static_blog_generator.html).
