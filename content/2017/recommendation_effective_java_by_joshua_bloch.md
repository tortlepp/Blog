Do you know the book "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch? If you are a Java developer, you should. At least that is my opinion. I read this book during the past weeks and I was really astonished. Although I have been using Java as my primary programming language for a couple of years, a good number of topics in the book showed me new and interesting facts.

Some topics were, of course, not that interesting. I already knew that it is a good idea to provide a custom `toString` method or to write Javadoc comments, at least for all non-private fields and methods. And well, I started to learn Java when version 6 has been already out - so, for example, I would never use generics with raw types.

But there are many other important and interesting topics. Implementing a singleton by using a single value enum? - I never heard about it before, but it is really reasonable to do so. Using `ExecutorService` to run tasks? - Cool, I did not know the executor facility. And so on...

I think this book is really worth to read. In fact, it is the only Java book I read from cover to cover.

There is only one disappointment: Unfortunately, the current edition of the book was written when Java 6. For most of the topics in the book that does not matter, they are still valid and worth to be discussed. But there was also was some evolution in the Java world - just think about lambda expressions. Some modern topics are really missing in the book. Luckily it seems that there is still hope for an updated edition, at least [Joshua Bloch announced a new edition](https://twitter.com/joshbloch/status/796939556658573312) and it is already [listed on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997).
