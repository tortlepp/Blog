Some time ago I released version 1.0 of SimpleTaskList, my editor for todo.txt files. And when I released it, I stated that it is feature complete and there will be no further active development. Anyway, today I released version 1.1 of SimpleTaskList. In the new release, there are just two small improvements which were necessary in my opinion:

- The program icon is now available in multiple sizes, which makes it look much better when it is resized; also I added a background to the icon in order to increase its visibility on dark backgrounds
- I added a context menu to the tasks shown in the table - if you right-click on a task you can now open the dialog to edit the task, mark the task as done, copy the description of the task to the clipboard and delete the task

The new release of SimpleTaskList is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tortlepp/SimpleTaskList/releases/tag/v1.1). So far there are no further releases planned - except a bug occurs or I discover another missing feature.
